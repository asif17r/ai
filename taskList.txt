### **Experiment–1** *(Marks = 6.0)*

**Design a Customize Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Handwritten Digit Classification with the following specifications:**

a) Generate a CNN model with:
  i. Two CNN hidden layers (Conv2D) of sizes 32, 64 followed by
  ii. ReLU Activation and
  iii. MaxPooling2D with Kernel size (3, 3), and Stride=(1,1)
  iv. Use Flatten Layers to convert the feature map into 1D with a Dense layer of size 64 followed by an output Dense Layer of size 10 with SoftMax Activation Function.

b) Display the generated CNN with the required number of parameters.
c) Use the **MNIST database** for training and testing.
d) Adopt **Data augmentation** (rotation, shift) with the MNIST dataset.
e) Train **two CNNs** using the original MNIST dataset and augmented MNIST dataset.
f) Use the test **MNIST dataset** as well as the augmented test MNIST dataset to predict the accuracy of the two trained CNNs.
g) Compare and plot the prediction accuracy of the two CNNs.

### **Experiment–2** *(Marks = 4.0)*

**Implement a simple deep neural network (DNN) for solving the polynomial equation**
  **y = 5x³ – 10x² – 20x + 10**
**with the following specifications:**

a) Use three hidden-layers of sizes 32, 64, and 128 and display the generated DNN with the required number of parameters.
b) Generate training samples within the range of -20 to +20. Use an appropriate method for normalizing the training data in the range of -1 to +1.
c) Use 5% of the samples as test data and 5% of the samples as validation data and the rest of the data for training the DNN with an appropriate number of epochs.
d) Display the training accuracy vs validation accuracy and training error vs validation error curves.
